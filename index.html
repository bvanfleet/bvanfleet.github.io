                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I am a software developer from central Utah.</p>
                <p>Growing up I knew I was going to be a scientist. However, I didn't know that it was going to be a computer scientist. My initial plan, fueled by Cartoon Network's Dexter's Lab, was to become a chemist. After failing AP Chemistry in my senior year of high school, I decided that I wasn't cut out to be a chemist. I then decided that my passion was computers and technology.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until I returned from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints that I began finding my niche within computers. Originally, I was going to be a game developer. I began studying at Utah Valley University and attended a career tour of EA Games (before they shut down their SLC office).</p>
                <p>My biggest pet peeve from EA, companies that hire computer scientists to do a job they <em>feel</em> a 12-year-old can do. Thanks EA Games, you ruined a career field for a college student, add that to your list of achievements.</p>
                <p>After leaving the Salt Lake office for EA, I determined that my next step was to complete a computer science degree, but not for game development.</p>
                <p><em>And here we are...</em></p>
